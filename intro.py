# Write a program to input marks of three tests of a student (all integers). Then calculate and print the average of all test marks

# m=int(input("enter the maths marks :"))
# eng =int(input("enter the english marks :"))
# physics=int(input("enter the physics marks :"))
# average=(m+eng+physics)/3
# print(average)


# You are given two integers: X and N. You have to calculate X raised to power N and print it.


x=int(input())
y=int(input())
print(x**y)
