# Write a program to input marks of three tests of a student (all integers). Then calculate and print the average of all test marks

# m=int(input("enter the maths marks :"))
# eng =int(input("enter the english marks :"))
# physics=int(input("enter the physics marks :"))
# average=(m+eng+physics)/3
# print(average)


# You are given two integers: X and N. You have to calculate X raised to power N and print it.


# x=int(input())
# y=int(input())
# print(x**y)


# You are given first three entries of an arithmetic progression. You have to calculate the common difference and print it

# Write your code here
a=int(input())
b=int(input())
c=int(input())
d=b-a
print(d)
