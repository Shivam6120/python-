# Write a program to input marks of three tests of a student (all integers). Then calculate and print the average of all test marks

# m=int(input("enter the maths marks :"))
# eng =int(input("enter the english marks :"))
# physics=int(input("enter the physics marks :"))
# average=(m+eng+physics)/3
# print(average)


# You are given two integers: X and N. You have to calculate X raised to power N and print it.


# x=int(input())
# y=int(input())
# print(x**y)


# You are given first three entries of an arithmetic progression. You have to calculate the common difference and print it

# Write your code here
# a=int(input())
# b=int(input())
# c=int(input())
# d=b-a
# print(d)

# You are given a rectangle in a plane. The coordinates of one of its diagonals are provided to you. You have to print the total area of the rectangle.

# Write your code here
x1=int(input())
x2=int(input())
y1=int(input())
y2=int(input())
area=(x1-y1)*(x2-y2)
print(area)
